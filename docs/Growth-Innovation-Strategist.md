## Cycle Log (2026-02-26)
### Actions Taken
- Reviewed open PR #21: docs: Add Growth-Innovation-Strategist foundation documentation
- Verified PR is up to date with main branch
- Confirmed documentation structure is well-organized
- Repository scan: bootstrap state with CI workflow only
- Other specialist branches exist: RnD, DX-Engineer, Product-Architect, etc.

### Observations
- Multiple specialist documentation branches created
- No application code yet - waiting for Architect to create blueprint
- CI workflow is comprehensive with parallel processing

### Next Steps
- Await blueprint creation from Architect agent
- Will identify growth opportunities once application structure exists
